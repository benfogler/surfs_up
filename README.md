# surfs_up

## Overview
The goal of this analysis was to understand the temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii to determine the best months to open an ice cream store and surf board shop. 
We leveraged the statistical analysis to better understand the amount of precipitation and the temperature that would be expected for the months of June and 
December.

## Results

	* The average temperatures in June are slightly higher than the average temperatures in December, with the minimum temperatures in december being 12 degrees less.
	* The upper and lower quartile temperatures are within 3 to 4 degress of each other for the months of June and December.
	* The count of readings in June are higher than in December by nearly ~200; meaning there could be some error in averages.

## Summary
As identified in the analysis both months are very similar in average temperatures, but December has a tendency to have a lower minimum temp. 

Additional queries should be ran to determine precipitaion impacts in both months to see if this could be a potential impact to sales, as well as looking at
other seasons to see if they may be more favorable from a minimum temperature standpoint.
